# OnePlan — Executive Summary (Part 6)

**What changed:**  
We optimized cross-channel budget to maximize **conversions** (and evaluated **deduped reach** separately).

## Headline Results
- **Modeled conversions lift vs equal split:** **0.0%**  
- **Deduped reach lift vs equal split:** **0.0%**  

## Why the optimizer shifted budget
- Channels with the **highest marginal ROI at the optimum** (extra conversions per $1): **Display, YouTube, LinearTV**  
- Channels with **lower marginal ROI** are relatively **saturated** at the current CPMs.

## Key Figures
- Optimal spend allocation (Conversions): `assets/p6_opt_spend_conversions.png`
- Marginal ROI at optimum: `assets/p6_marginal_roi.png`
- Equal vs Optimized (Conversions): `assets/p6_equal_vs_opt_conversions.png`
- Equal vs Optimized (Deduped Reach): `assets/p6_equal_vs_opt_reach.png`

## Notes & Assumptions
- Response curves learned from daily synthetic data (Part 3), smoothed (Savitzky–Golay) for stability.
- Deduped reach modeled with a pairwise-overlap heuristic (Part 4).
- CPMs held constant; budget fixed at $1,000,000.
